# RetroPie-Toolkit
Shell Script for setting up RetroPie 

I am new to the RetroPie community and have been downloading pre built images. This got me interested in building my own
image with what I wanted, some images had features I really like but not all of them had everything. I started this script in the
hopes I could start building my own and instead of taking notes I would add it to the script so that it is repeatable every
time I wanted to start over with a new image. 

feel free to use my script. I hope it is usefull for others.

Thanks to everyone who has put in hard work on developing and modding RetroPie and special thanks to the ones whom 
I am useing there work in my script.
